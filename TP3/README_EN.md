# TP 3: Modeling and Analysis of an Automated Production System

## üè≠ Story: CNC Manufacturing Solutions

**CNC Manufacturing Solutions** is a company specializing in the production of high-precision mechanical parts for the aerospace industry. The company owns several CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines, each capable of producing different parts. These machines depend on a complex network of **suppliers** for raw materials, cutting tools, and maintenance contracts.

### üö® The Challenge

Following a major breakdown of one of their main CNC machines, the company must:
1. Quickly identify **which customer orders are affected**
2. Find **alternative machines** capable of producing the same parts
3. Calculate the **shortest path** to obtain necessary materials
4. Assess the **cascading impact** if a critical supplier fails
5. Identify **bottlenecks** in the production process

You will model this system using **advanced patterns** and **graph algorithms** to help the company make quick and informed decisions.

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start simple**: Create a few nodes of each type first to test
2. **Use CREATE to build everything in one block**: More efficient and keeps variables available
3. **Test your relationships**: Use simple MATCH to verify connections are correct
4. **Visualize**: Neo4j Browser displays the graph visually - use it!
5. **reduce() is your friend**: For multiplying quantities, adding costs/lead times
6. **OPTIONAL MATCH**: Essential when some nodes may not have the pattern
7. **WHERE NONE()**: Very useful to exclude certain nodes from paths
8. **Think business**: Each query solves a real engineering problem!

## üèÜ Final Challenge

**Mission Impossible**: The management team asks you for a complete report:

1. **Current state**: Which orders are in danger?
2. **Risk analysis**: What are our 3 most critical suppliers?
3. **Plan B**: How to reorganize production with CNC Mill Alpha-5000 down?
4. **Optimization**: What is the fastest AND cheapest plan for Order #A001?
5. **Recommendations**: What machines should we buy to reduce single points of failure?

Use ALL the patterns and algorithms learned to create this report!
